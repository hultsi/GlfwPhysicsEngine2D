# GLFW Physics engine

Just started a small project to fine tune my understanding of cpp. 

## Engine capabilities for now:
  * Show screen
  * Draw rectangles
  * Possibility to add key listeners
  * Collision detection for convex shapes
  * Finding collision points for convex shapes
  * Finding collision normals for convex shapes
  * Bouncing off of each other for convex shapes

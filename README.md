# GLFW Physics engine

Just started a small project to fine tune my understanding of cpp.
Uses OpenGL3.x instead of 4.

Just started a small project to fine tune my understanding of cpp. 
Uses OpenGL3.x instead of 4.

## Engine capabilities for now:
  * Show screen
  * Draw rectangles
  * Add key listeners
  * Collision detection for rectangles
  
       Easily rewritable for all convex shapes
  
## Next up:
  * Handling collision (e.g., stuff not going inside each other)
  * Forces
     
     which basically means implementing:
        
       * Few mathematical methods for ODEs
       * Some new properties
       * And few other things
       * E.g., will take a lot of time

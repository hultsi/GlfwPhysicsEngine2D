# GLFW Physics engine

Just started a small project to fine tune my understanding of cpp.
Uses OpenGL3.x instead of 4.

## Engine capabilities for now:

- Show screen
- Draw rectangles
- Add key listeners
- Collision detection for rectangles

  Easily rewritable for all convex shapes

- Handling collision (e.g., stuff not going inside each other)

## Next up:

- Calculate elastic collisions and apply them

For the project to work, get GLFW from https://www.glfw.org .
